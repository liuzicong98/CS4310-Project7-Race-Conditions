1 - Python dependencies:

threading
time
random

2 - How to run:

Assignment 1: Experiment with different values of n, k, and t until a race condition is observed.

git clone --branch ass1 https://github.com/liuzicong98/CS4310-Project7-Race-Conditions.git

python ass1.py

When a race condition is observed, the program will stop.

Assignment 2: Modify the solution by including the necessary P and V operations in the code. If general P and V operations are not provided by the tread library then first implement P and V using binary semaphores (mutex lock or spin locks.)

git clone --branch ass2 https://github.com/liuzicong98/CS4310-Project7-Race-Conditions.git

python ass2.py

The program will always run until you enter ctrl-c.
